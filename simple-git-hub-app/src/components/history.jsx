          <span>
            Launched in 2015, our Pet Store Division was created with a mission
            to enhance the lives of pets and their owners through exceptional
            service and care. With over 150 locations nationwide, we offer a
            comprehensive selection of pet food, accessories, grooming
            services, and veterinary care. Our stores are organized to provide
            a seamless customer experience—grouped by pet types such as dogs,
            cats, birds, reptiles, and small animals—making it easier for
            visitors to find exactly what they need. In addition to retail, we
            support pet adoption initiatives and collaborate with local shelters
            to promote responsible pet ownership and community engagement.
